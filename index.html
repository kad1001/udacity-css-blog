            <p>Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am
                not
                going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to
                others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts
                towards
                others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as
                much as
                I can. <a href="pages/blog.html">Read more</a></p>

            <p>There is only one important point you must keep in your mind and let it be your guide. No matter what
                people call you, you are just who you are. Keep to this truth. You must ask yourself how is it you
                want
                to live your life. We live and we die, this is the truth that we can only face alone. No one can
                help
                us, not even the Buddha. So consider carefully, what prevents you from living the way you want to
                live
                your life? <a href="pages/blog.html">Read more</a></p>
